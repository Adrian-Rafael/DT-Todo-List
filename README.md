For my HTML file I created a div container called "todo-container" it'll be the main container for my other container. I created a second div container called "input-container" together with input and add button it'll be the basic input user output.

For my style.css I just use neutral colors simple as possible. As you can see the background I used linear-gradient with a 135 degree. I centered the "todo-container" and the h2("todo-header") also give simple design into our button. 

For my javascript file I declared the three variables taskInput, addButton and tasklist. Created a three functions called addTask, deleteTask and toggleComplete also added some css code.
